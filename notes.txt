Difference between JSX & HTML

HTML
    Open tags with no matching close tags are allowed
    "for" attribute is allowed
    "class" attribute is allowed

JSX
    Every open tag must have a corresponding close tag
    use "htmlFor" in place of "for"
    use "className' in place of "class"


Create a Calculator component which will accept 2 operands from the user
Display 4 buttons for the operators (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
When any of the buttons are clicked, perform the respective operation and show the result to the user


UI State
    - Data that supports the presentation logic of the component
    - It is highly UNLIKELY that this data is needed in other parts of the application (outside this component)
    - Feel free to maintain this data in the component state

App State
    - Data that supports the domain of the application
    - It is highly LIKELY that this data is needed in other parts of the application
    - DONOT maintain this data in the component state

Managing Products
    
    Initial state = []

    Actions
        ADD_PRODUCT
        REMOVE_PRODUCT

React Hooks
    functions
        state,
        lifecycle
    must start with 'use'

    builtin hooks
        useState
        useEffects
        useReducer
        useRef
        useMemo
        useCallback
